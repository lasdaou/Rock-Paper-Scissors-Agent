# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Agent
Final Project within the scope of the course "Machine Learning" of the MSc Program "Data &amp; Web Science" of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and implement an intelligent agent capable of learning to play the classic game Rock-Scissor-Paper. The agent will be trained to analyze images corresponding to three symbols: 0 for Rock, 1 for Scissor, and 2 for Paper. The objective is for the agent to choose the symbol that beats the one shown in the input image.

Features
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to enable the agent's learning process.

Image Recognition: The agent is trained to recognize and interpret images representing Rock, Scissor, and Paper symbols.

Decision Making: Employs a decision-making mechanism to select the optimal symbol that defeats the opponent's symbol.
