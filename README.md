# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Agent
Final Project within the scope of the course "Machine Learning" of the MSc Program "Data &amp; Web Science" of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and implement an intelligent agent capable of learning to play the classic game Rock-Scissor-Paper. The agent will be trained to analyze images corresponding to three symbols: 0 for Rock, 1 for Scissor, and 2 for Paper and he should choose the corresponding move that wins the round.
